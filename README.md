## 📌 Project Description
The **Healthcare Wellness Chatbot** is a digital wellness assistant designed to provide **emotional support** and **basic health guidance** through structured conversational flows.  
It was built using **Chatbot.com** with a carefully crafted persona that responds empathetically to user inputs.  

The chatbot helps users manage their wellness journey by offering:
- Emotional check-ins (e.g., stress, loneliness, mood support)  
- Calming and self-care activity suggestions  
- Basic lifestyle and health tips (hydration, exercise, sleep)  
- Responses to common user queries related to mental health and wellness  

## 🎯 What It Does
- Acts as a **supportive companion** for users seeking comfort or guidance  
- Provides **instant suggestions** for stress relief, calming activities, or self-reflection  
- Handles **common questions** like “I feel anxious,” “How can I sleep better?”, or “What should I do if I’m stressed?”  
- Offers a **safe, empathetic conversational experience** while keeping responses simple and non-medical  

The project demonstrates how a chatbot can be structured to deliver **compassionate wellness support** using no-code tools and structured prompt design.
